        <p> Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

            I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
            
            She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
            
            In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
            
            The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
            
            Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'
            
            Didn't make sense not to live for fun
            
            Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
            
            So much to do so much to see
            
            So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets
            
            You'll never know if you don't go
            
            You'll never shine if you don't glow
            
            Hey, now You're an all-star
            
            Get your game on, go play
            
            Hey, now You're a rock star
            
            Get the show on, get paid
            
            And all that glitters is gold
            
            Only shootin' stars break the mold
            
            It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
            
            You're bundled up now but wait till you get older
            
            But the meteor men beg to differ
            
            Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
            
            The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
            
            The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
            
            My world's on fire
            
            How 'bout yours
            
            That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
            
            Hey, now, you're an all-star
            
            {Shouting}
            
            Get your game on, go play
            
            Hey, now You're a rock star
            
            Get the show on, get paid
            
            And all that glitters is gold
            
            Only shootin' stars break the mold
            
            {Belches}
            
            Go!
            
            Go!
            
            {Record Scratching}
            
            Go. Go.Go.
            
            Hey, now, you're an all-star
            
            Get your game on, go play
            
            Hey, now You're a rock star
            
            Get the show on, get paid
            
            And all that glitters is gold
            
            Only shootin' stars break the mold
